Now, you can run Locust from the command line. The command below will simulate the behavior of 10 users making a total of 1000 requests:

`locust -f locustfile.py --headless -u 10 -r 1 -t 1000`

Explanation of Command:
-f locustfile.py: The Locust test file that defines your test cases.
--headless: Runs Locust in the terminal without the web UI.
-u 10: Simulate 10 users.
-r 1: Start 1 user per second until reaching the total number of users (10 in this case).
-t 1000: Number of total requests or duration. You can replace this with a time duration like 1m (for 1 minute) or 1h (for 1 hour).
