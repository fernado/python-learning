## Frameworks That Use Jinja2:
* Flask: Jinja2 is the default templating engine.
* Django: While Django has its own templating language, Jinja2 can also be used as an alternative.

Jinja2 is a powerful and flexible templating engine that is widely used in Python web development, and it perfectly fits the syntax and features described in your string template.


Ensure that your index.html file is inside the templates directory. Flask automatically looks inside this directory when you call render_template
